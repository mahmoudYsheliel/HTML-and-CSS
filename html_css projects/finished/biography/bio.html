        <p>Aang was an Air Nomad born in 12 BG and the Avatar
        during the Hundred Year War, succeeding Avatar Roku[7]
        and preceding Avatar Korra. As the Avatar of his time,
        he was the only person capable of using all four bending
        arts: airbending, waterbending, earthbending, and 
        firebending. He was also one of a select few Avatars
        and one of the first in many cycles[8] to learn the
        ancient art of energybending and the first Avatar 
        known to have actively used the technique.</p>
